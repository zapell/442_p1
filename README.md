This project focused on aligning RBG image channels to create a color image from black and white photos.

The motivation comes from Russian photographer Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863-1944), via a project invented by Russian-American vision researcher, Alexei A. Efros (1975-present).  Sergei was a visionary who believed in a future with color photography. During his lifetime, he traveled across the Russian Empire taking photographs through custom color filters at the whim of the czar. To capture color for the photographers of the future, he decided to take three separate black-and-white pictures of every scene, each with a red, green, or blue color filter in front of the camera.

The main objective was to transform a picture like
